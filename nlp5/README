In this exercise we implemented the MST parser
for unlabeled dependency parsing, using the average perceptron algorithm
We used several features, such as Word bigrams and POS bigrams.
As well as some additional features including the edges direction and length.
We trained the model by the described scheme for 2 epochs
and then tested it on the test set, results are discribed in the pdf and in the RESULTS file.
